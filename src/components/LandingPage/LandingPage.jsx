            <p>
            The Results Foundation was established in 2015 by RE/MAX Results to give back 
            to local communities by providing grants and scholarships to organizations and 
            individuals throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin, believing thereâ€™s no greater investment 
            than helping individuals and communities overcome obstacles and achieve their goals. 
            Inspired by the philanthropic work of the Sales Executives and staff of RE/MAX Results,  
            the foundation has donated nearly $250,000 in grants to date.
